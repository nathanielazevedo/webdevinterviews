      "This code initializes an array 'arr' with three elements. The statement 'arr[4];' tries to access the element at index 4, which is out of bounds because arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed. This will result in 'undefined', but it won't throw an error.",

      "A string 'str' is defined as 'dog'. The statement 'str[4] = 'a';' attempts to change the character at index 4 to 'a', but strings in JavaScript are immutable, so this line won't change the string. However, it won't throw an error.",
