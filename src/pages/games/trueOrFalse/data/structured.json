        "explanation": "When using the + operator with arrays, JavaScript first coerces both arrays to strings by joining their elements with commas. After coercion the expression becomes '1,2' + '1,2' == '1,21,2'. This expression evaluates to true."

        "question": "[] + 1 === '1'",
        "explanation": "When you use the + operator with an array [] and a number, JavaScript coerces the array into an empty string ''. After type coercion the expression becomes '' + 1 == '1'. This expression evaluates to true."
